This is a collection of Matlab scripts and Mathematica notebooks I accumulated while doing research with Munday Lab @ UMD College Park. Most of the Code centers around the simulation of nematic liquid crystal hemispheres. I won't go too far into that in this README, but if you somehow stumble accross this and are curious shoot me an email (sgillen@umd.edu). 

Shout out to David Somers, who wrote a fair amount of this code, and guided me through all the complicated math throughout.
