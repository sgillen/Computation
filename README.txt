This is a collection of Matlab scripts and Mathematica notebooks that together simulate nematic liquid crystals. We're playing around with both Q Tensor and Frank-Oseen Free energy representations of LC's.

As it stands, basically everything in this folder was written by David Somers, just want to give credit where it's due.
