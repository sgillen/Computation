This is a collection of Matlab scripts and Mathematica notebooks I accumulated while doing research with Munday Lab @ UMD College Park. Most of the Code centers around the simulation of nematic liquid crystal hemispheres, which the group wanted to use to measure something called the Casimir torque. I won't go too far into that in this README, but if you somehow stumble accross this and are curious shoot me an email (sgillen@umd.edu). 

This was research code, one time use, and is an unapologetic mess. I don't suggest you use it, but it might be useful as a reference.

Shout out to David Somers, a former grad student in Munday Lab that guided me throughout the project.
